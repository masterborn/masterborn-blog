From digital banking and insurance to lending and wealth management, Fintech companies and budding startups are growing fast today. And, California is the origin of many successful ventures that have earned global fame.

Read on to find out more about the most impressive California-based Fintech companies.

## What is Fintech?

Fintech is the name given to the cluster of Fintech companies that deliver innovative products and services, which compete with traditional means of delivering financial services.
This emerging industry uses technology to improve these services and make them more accessible. The best example of Fintech is the use of smartphones for mobile banking, investing, and lending services.



## When was Fintech first used?

The word “Fintech” appeared for the first time in the 1980s when Peter Knight  - the editor of the Sunday Times business newsletter - used it to describe a bot that had changed his mailbox.



But how did Fintech as we know it emerge?

The Global Financial Crisis in 2008 increased public distrust of traditional financial institutions. This, in turn, led to a shift in mindset and opened the doors to a brand-new industry that we call Fintech today.

The release of Bitcoin v0.1 in 2009 and the boom of different cryptocurrencies impacted the financial world as well.

Another critical factor that led to the emergence of Fintech was the mass-market penetration of smartphones that brought internet access to millions of people across the world. These consumers were open to using mobile payments and mobile applications for carrying out financial operations, powering the rise of Fintech.
