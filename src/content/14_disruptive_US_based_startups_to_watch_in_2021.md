When it comes to startups and innovative tech, the United States is way more than just Silicon Valley today. The country is full of tech hubs that give birth to countless exciting startups.

As the largest tech market in the world representing 33% of the total - or approximately [$1.6 trillion in 2021](https://www.comptia.org/content/research/it-industry-trends-analysis) - the U.S. is one of the best places for startups.

Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, founders enjoyed a stream of funding for realizing their ideas. U.S.-based venture capital funds raised a combined [$69.1 billion in 2020](https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/us-vc-fundraising-hits-record-69b-in-2020-after-a16z-closes-two-mega-funds), with highlights Andreessen Horowitz announcing a couple of mega-funds with $4.5 billion in commitments.

So, what are the most interesting startups that we’re all going to hear about in 2021? Here are 14 companies on the path to disrupting their industries.

### HealthTech

Founded: **2012**<br/>
Location: **Columbus, Ohio**<br/>
Funding (last round): **$385 million**<br/>
Valuation: **$1.5 billion**<br/>

Brand claim: “Olive builds artificial intelligence and RPA solutions that empower healthcare organizations to improve efficiency and patient care while reducing costly administrative errors.”

Olive develops AI and RPA solutions (a technology involving bots that mimic human actions to complete repetitive tasks) that help healthcare companies improve their efficiency and deliver better patient care while reducing costly administrative errors. Healthcare systems and employees work hard to manage essential processes, so they need solutions like Olive, even when not dealing with pandemics.

The company is looking to make healthcare more data-driven, efficient, affordable, and human - and Olive believes that artificial intelligence is capable of making this a reality. Olive’s CEO Sean Lane was looking for the next challenge after a career at NASA: “Looking for what was next, I was drawn in by the prescription drug abuse problem that consumed my hometown of Gallipolis, Ohio and impacted my family personally. I wanted to do something meaningful, and that’s when I started looking at healthcare.”

In the last round, Olive raised a smashing $385 million from investors, proving that their idea has a solid foundation.

Funding: **$1.09 billion**<br/>

Brand claim: “What if a healthier planet began with a healthier farm? From questions we grow.”

Indigo is an AgriTech startup that focuses on providing microbial technology for plant protection, which is essential in the food production process. The company developed a technology that improves yield potential, helps to achieve a superior milling quality, and protects plants against environmental stresses.

The startup began its operation in 2014 under the name Symbiota. IT developed microbial seed treatments that helped farmers grow corn, rice, soybeans, and wheat without using too many fertilizers, fungicides, and other chemicals.

Indigo then expanded its business lines to become an Amazon for agriculture, running a number of marketplaces that connect grain growers, buyers, and shippers. The newest ambition of Indigo is the carbon sequestration program that trains farmers on how to use “regenerative” farming practices.

While it seems super-scientific, this could impact us all in terms of the quality and price of food products.

## What’s in store for U.S.-based startups in 2021?

![america_flag_image](assets/14_disruptive_US_based_startups_to_watch_in_2021/american_flag.jpeg)

2021 is going to be an exciting year for U.S.-based startups. Those that are planning an expansion to European markets will have to deal with [a host of new regulations](https://alliedforstartups.org/2021/01/06/whats-in-store-for-startup-policy-in-2021/) such as the Digital Services Act, Digital Markets Act, or Data Governance Act. At home, they’re bound to face some more regulation as well.

Apart from that, we’re likely to see more products built with innovative technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Virtual and Augmented Reality, and the Internet of Things. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our daily lives, new startups will arise to help us deal with the lockdown-induced problems and improve our daily lives.

At MasterBorn, we have helped many startups disrupt their industries and know what it takes to build a successful product. If you’re a startup founder looking for support in technology, don’t hesitate to drop me a line on LinkedIn or at malgorzata.g@masterborn.com.
