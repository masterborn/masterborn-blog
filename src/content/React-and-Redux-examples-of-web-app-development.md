# React and Redux - 10 examples of successful Web App Development


At MasterBorn, we bet on quality, not quantity. The approach of “less is more” works well for us and we apply it to both the people we hire and the technologies we add to our stack.
Fun Fact: last year, we hired 0.70% of candidates who applied to us (3576 in total!).
And we approach our tech stack in a similar manner. Let’s take front-end development as an example. Today, our JavaScript tech stack looks like this:

## JavaScript Tech Stack: React & Node.js

Such a narrow specialization allows us to work at a global level, bringing together experienced senior developers who know their technology inside and out. We’re always busy expanding our knowledge to achieve JavaScript mastery. And we translate this expertise to the solutions we build for our clients, balancing and optimizing their cost and performance.

Node.js is a backend development technology. The backend of a web application is the place where its data is stored and served from.

React, on the other hand, is one of the most popular choices for front-end development. The front-end of a web application is the part that users see and interact with when they load it on a desktop, laptop, or mobile device. The front-end and backend communicate using an API or a library.
In this article, we focus on two front-end technologies - React and another Javascript library, Redux.

**Almost half of React applications use Redux today.** The question is - why is Redux gaining so much steam? And, is React becoming more popular thanks to Redux?
Keep on reading to understand these two front-end tools better and discover how tech giants and startups alike benefit from them in web development.



## What is React?

![What_is_react](./assets/React-and-Redux-examples-of-web-app-development/What_is_React.jpg)

React is a JavaScript library that engineers use to build user interfaces and components for web applications. Today, React is a popular choice among companies looking to build complex web pages, as well as their layouts and content.

React was developed by Jordan Walke at Facebook and was initially used to build Facebook’s feed in 2011. Later on, Facebook developers used it to develop Instagram in 2012. In 2013, React became an open-source library, and today it’s maintained by its community with the help of Facebook.

### React vs. React Native - what's the difference?

The name React might bring to mind another technology - React Native. Don’t confuse these two because they serve entirely different purposes.

While React is a library for web development, React Native is a React-based framework used to build cross-platform mobile applications. React Native was developed by Facebook as well, and today it’s used as one of the primary cross-platform tools for creating native iOS and Android mobile applications.



## What is Redux?

![What_is_Redux](./assets/React-and-Redux-examples-of-web-app-development/What_is_Redux.jpg)

Redux is an open-source JavaScript library written in JavaScript itself. It was initially released in 2015 by Dan Abramov and Andrew Clark.

The key advantage of Redux lies in its compatibility with other JavaScript libraries such as React, Ember, and Angular. You can use Redux to enhance your complex JavaScript application. Engineers also love Redux for its time-traveling debugger that enables live code editing.



## React vs. Redux - what's the difference?

![React_vs_Redux_what_s_the_difference](./assets/React-and-Redux-examples-of-web-app-development/React_vs_Redux_what_s_the_difference.jpg)

To explain the difference between React and Redux, we need to focus on one key detail - states. Every application needs a method for managing state.

React state is stored locally, within a component. When the state needs to be shared with other components, it’s simply passed down through props. What does this mean for your app? That its top-most component that requires access to a mutable value will hold that value in its state.

In Redux, on the other hand, the state is stored globally in the Redux store. Any component that needs access to a value can subscribe to the store and easily gain access to the value.

Redux helps to centralize all data while enabling components to get the state it needs - without other components knowing that. These two technologies are often used together - as you will see in the following examples of some pretty impressive applications.



## Why use React?

Why has React become so popular?



### React is declarative

This means that software engineers can create interactive UIs easily. It also makes the application’s code more predictable and easier to debug.

### Gentle learning curve

Compared to other popular JavaScript-based frameworks like Angular, React is simple to learn and use.



### React is component-based

Components are basically building blocks of React pages, and the good news is that they’re reusable. This accelerates the development process.

### Massive community

React is surrounded by a large community of developers who share their knowledge and are happy to help one another. This means that finding skilled coders for your project is easier.

### React supports mobile development

React Native is growing fast and becoming a key technology for developing native mobile applications.

## 5 Examples of Successful Web Apps Built with React

### React App #1: Netflix
![Netflix_app](./assets/React-and-Redux-examples-of-web-app-development/Netflix.jpg)

Location: **Los Gatos, CA** <br/>
Founded: **1997**<br/>
Funding: **[$3.2B](https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organizations/funding_total/netflix)**<br/>
Revenue: **$24.99B (in 2020)**<br/>
Users: **203.66 million**<br/>


The Netflix team used React to develop the most popular video streaming web application on the internet. They even [published a blog post](http://techblog.netflix.com/2015/01/netflix-likes-react.html) that explains how React helps them to increase startup speed, optimize runtime performance, and improve many other things.

As the Netflix UI engineers say:

#### “Our decision to adopt React was influenced by a number of factors, most notably: 1) startup speed, 2) runtime performance, and 3) modularity.”

### React App #2: Dropbox
![Dropbox](./assets/React-and-Redux-examples-of-web-app-development/Dropbox.jpg)

Location: **San Francisco, CA**<br/>
Founded: **2007**<br/>
